# Homepage for the Addiction ShortCourse 2018

Welcome to the Addiction ShortCourse Workshop Homepage! On here, you will find the datasets and scripts for each afternoons workshop organized in a sequential manner. But before we dive right in to that, here are some details regarding the software and programming enviornments we will be using. 

## [Python]
You can learn more about Python [here](https://www.python.org/about/) but very briefly, Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Python is a very useful and robust language that allows for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python supports several modules and packages for statistical, genentics and genomics analysis, making it a programmiung language of choice in our area of work. Last but not the least, Python facilitates **reproducible** analysis, like the other programming languages we will be using in this ShortCourse.

## Jupyter Notebook
The [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application platform that allows users to create and share code, narrative text and visualizations. It is commonly used in conjuction with Python for purposes such as data cleaning and transformation, statistical modeling and data visualization in addition to much more. Jupyter Notebooks are a great way of enabling and excuting repdroducible research.

## R

## RStudio
RStudio is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, and a variety of robust tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace.
